## About Me

I'm a freshly graduated Data Scientist, passionate about applying AI and machine learning to real-world domains and witnessing how these technologies evolve. My expertise spans regression and classification models, as well as large language models (LLMs). I am always eager to learn and contribute, bringing a curious mindset and a desire to make an impact.

Outside of data science, I enjoy a wide range of sports — from basketball, badminton, tennis, and rock climbing, to chess. I also love to challenge myself by training my memory.
