## About Me

I'm a freshly graduated Data Scientist, passionate about applying AI and machine learning to real-world domains and witnessing how these technologies evolve. My expertise spans regression and classification models, as well LLMs. I am always eager to learn and contribute, bringing a curious mindset and a desire to make an impact.

Outside of data science, I enjoy a variety of sports and activities — from basketball, inline skating, and rock climbing to chess, darts, and bowling. I usually prefer being actively involved rather than just watching. I'm also into cooking !

**Personal projects:**
Analysis and recognition of CrossFit movements from data from inertial sensors
